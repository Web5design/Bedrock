# Bedrock
A responsive, mobile first 18 column grid. A theoretical grid for today's layout challenges. Pull it apart, modify it, or extend your favorite grid framework with the mobile classes.

Checkout the demo to [see Bedrock in action](http://dfcb.github.com/Bedrock/) and find documentation in css/bedrock.css.

## Quick Start
1. Grab [bedrock.css](https://github.com/dfcb/Bedrock/blob/master/css/custom/style.css)
2. Include the file before your stylesheet or prepend to your CSS
3. Update the media query in bedrock.css to respond correctly for your project
4. See the examples in [index.html](https://github.com/dfcb/Bedrock/blob/master/index.html) for a basic grid setup
5. Build your project

* Optionally add gutters by adding <code>.gutters</code> to <code>.grid-container</code>
* Mobile classes: <code>.whole</code>, <code>.half</code> and <code>.third</code> 


## The Grid
<pre>                   18
             9            9
      6            6             6
  3      3      3      3      3     3
1 1 1  1 1 1  1 1 1  1 1 1  1 1 1  1 1 1</pre>


## Closing Thoughts
This project exists to explore a mobile first grid solution in a responsive web. Our goal is not to "muddy the waters" with more grid frameworks. As stated above, it's really to demonstrate the mobile approach and a utility best.
